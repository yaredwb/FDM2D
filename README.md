# Finite Difference Method
## Application to Steady-state Flow in 2D

Code and excerpt from lecture notes demonstrating application of the finite difference method (FDM) to steadt-state flow in two dimensions. The extracted lecture note is taken from a course I taught entitled Advanced Computational Methods in Geotechnical Engineering.
